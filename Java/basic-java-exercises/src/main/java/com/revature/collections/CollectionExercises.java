    INSTRUCTIONS:
        Step 1.
            Create another class in this package that represents an item in a to-do list.
            It needs to have at least three properties (e.g. id, description, isComplete)

        Step 2.
            Make this class executable (add a main method) and create at least three different Collections of your to-do items
            (e.g. a List, Queue, and Set). Play around and see which

        Step 3.
            Using the built-in methods for each type of collection... add, remove, copy, and sort (if possible) the
            different to-do items in your collections.
            Print out the collections before and after these operations to validate that they're working
            N.B. you'll need to override the toString() method in the class you create

        Step 4.
            Create methods that have parameters as different collection types and return a collection
            (we want to be able to pass in a collection and return a collection as well)
            (e.g. a method that takes in an ArrayList of to-do items and removes all the ones marked as complete)
