    Step 1.
        - Provide this class with:
            - two instance variables
            - a no-args constructor
            - a parameterized constructor
            - two methods

    Step 2.
        - Create a second class in this package called ChildClass that inherits from ParentClass

        - For one of the methods you declared in this ParentClass, make it so that the ChildClass has
            a different behavior
            For example: if parentClassObject.work()  prints out " parent battles existential dread all day every day "
                        then childClassObject.work() prints out "making mud pies and chasing frogs"
