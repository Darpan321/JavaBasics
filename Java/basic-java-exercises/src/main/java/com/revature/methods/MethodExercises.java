    Password must include:
        - A length of 8 characters or more
        - At least one uppercase letter
        - At least one lowercase letter

    For example, if given 10 as an argument, the method should return 55.

    4. Write a method that will take any number of String arguments and return a single String as a sentence
    For example: if I pass in 3 arguments ("coding", "is", "fun") the method should return "coding is fun"
    Extra challenge: capitalize the first word of the sentence and add a period.

    For example: yourMethod(10, "haha") should return false
                yourMethod(1, "Hello") should return true
