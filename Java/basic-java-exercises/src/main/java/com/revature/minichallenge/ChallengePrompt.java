    Challenge: I've provided you with some code that is not fully implemented. Your task is to add code
    to the classes in this package so that when you run the main method in TriviaGame, you can play the trivia game
    in your console.
    Extra challenge: Save Player points to a file so they can keep track of how they've improved.


    DIRECTIONS

    Step 1.
        Encapsulate each of the classes in this package by making the fields private and writing getters and setters.
        Don't use the "Generate getters and setters" feature of your IDE.

    Step 2.
        In the TriviaGame class, implement the generateQuiz() method to create your quiz
